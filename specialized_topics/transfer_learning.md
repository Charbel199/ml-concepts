# Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one
task is re-purposed on a second related task.

This is done by using the trained model as a starting point,
and then fine-tuning the model to the new task using a small amount of labeled data.
Transfer learning is useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of labeled data and
computational resources needed to train a model for a new task, especially when the new task
is similar to the original task.
