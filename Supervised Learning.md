# Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is already known.
The goal of the algorithm is to learn from this labeled data and make predictions on new, unseen data.

There are two main types of supervised learning:

- *Classification*: The goal is to predict a categorical label, such as "spam" or "not spam" for an email.
- *Regression*: The goal is to predict a continuous value, such as the price of a house given its attributes.


Supervised learning algorithms include:

- [SVM](SVM.md)
- [KNN](KNN.md)
- [Random Forest](Random%20Forest.md)
- [Naive Bayes](Naive%20Bayes.md)

Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different types of problems and datasets. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem
and the characteristics of the dataset.

## How it works
The supervised learning process can be broken down into three main steps:

1) *Training*: The algorithm is fed the labeled dataset, and it uses this data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.
2) *Validation*: The algorithm is tested on a separate dataset, called the validation set, to evaluate its performance.
3) *Testing*: The final step is to test the algorithm on a completely unseen dataset, called the test set, to evaluate its performance.

## Pros and Cons
The main advantage of supervised learning is that it can make accurate predictions when the relationship between inputs and
outputs is well understood. However, it requires a large amount of labeled data to train the algorithm, and it is limited
by the assumption that the relationship between inputs and outputs will remain consistent in future, unseen data.

In summary, supervised learning is a powerful technique for making predictions when labeled data is available. It
is widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
It is important to choose the right algorithm and have a good understanding of the dataset before training a supervised learning model.
