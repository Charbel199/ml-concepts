# Unsupervised Learning 

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is not given any labeled data, and the goal is to discover the underlying
structure or pattern in the data. Unlike supervised learning, the algorithm is not given any specific task to perform and must find the structure in the data on its own.

There are two main types of unsupervised learning:

- *Clustering*: The goal is to group similar data points together.
- *Dimensionality Reduction*: The goal is to reduce the number of features in the data while retaining as much information as possible.

Unsupervised learning algorithms include:

- [K-Means](K-Means.md)
- [Principle Component Analysis](Principle%20Component%20Analysis.md)

Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different types of problems and datasets. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem and the characteristics of the dataset.

## How it works

The unsupervised learning process is similar to the supervised learning process. The algorithm is fed the unlabeled dataset and it uses this data to discover patterns or structure in the data. Depending on the specific algorithm, it may also require the user to specify certain parameters, such as the number of clusters for a clustering algorithm.

## Pros and Cons

The main advantage of unsupervised learning is that it can discover hidden patterns in the data without any prior knowledge of the outcome.
However, it can be difficult to interpret the results and it does not provide a specific output.

In summary, unsupervised learning is a powerful technique for discovering patterns in data when labeled data is not available.
It is widely used in various applications such as anomaly detection, image compression, and density estimation.
It is important to choose the right algorithm and have a good understanding of the dataset before training an unsupervised learning model.
