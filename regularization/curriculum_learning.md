# Curriculum Learning

Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that trains a machine learning model from easier data to harder data, which
imitates the meaningful learning order in human curricula.

The aim of CL is to help supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised learning achieve a performance boost and faster convergence. Specifically, CL is useful when 

* The task is hard
* Parts of the training data are difficult to learn
* The target distribution heavily shifts from training distribution
