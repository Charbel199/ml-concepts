# Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a preprocessing technique because we only work on the data to train our model.
In this technique, new instances of existing images are generated through the following actions:

* Geometric transformations
* Flipping
* Color space transformations
* Cropping
* Rotation
* Translation
* Noise injection
* Kernel filters
* Mixing images (Ex: Averaging pixel values)
* Random erasing
* GAN-based Data Augmentation
* Neural Style Transfer
